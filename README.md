Website for recipes 
Project 1: Create an HTML website that lists recipes. I will set up Git/GitHub and directories/files correctly, then create an HTML boilerplate and enter headings, lists, links to other pages, images and dimensions, and text styles. Finally, I will make the website visible online.
