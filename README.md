Website for recipes 
Project 1. Creating an HTML website that lists my favouroite recipes. This will test my ability to create a website from a boilerplate after setting up Git/GitHub and my directories/files correctly. I will then need to create a boilerplate, include headings, lists, links to other pages, images and dimensions, and text styles, and finally make the website visible online.
